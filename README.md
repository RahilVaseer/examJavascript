# examJavascript

in this Exam we have implemented A full stack chat application. 

I've implemented react application with react and react router.

I have created routing with react router. we have 4 routes 2 public and 2 privates routes.

the private routes will be profile route and chat route.

I've developed backend in node js, express js and websockets for real time messages. 

I have used socketio for the wss communication.

I've implemented testing in Jest.

I've use mongodb local to store the records in the database.

we have socket handshake and on handshake we get the History of the application stored in the database.

when clients sends the message we save the message in the database. and broadcosting message to the other users.


Difficulties and challanges

the login with google and openID is not implemented due to the error of creating google console account.

the app is not deployed to the heroku due to heroku cli authentication error but the app runs perfect of localhsot.
